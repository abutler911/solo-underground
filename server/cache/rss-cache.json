      "description": "Crews search for survivors after more than 120 injured at Jet Set in Santo Domingo At least 18 people have died and more than 120 injured after a roof collapsed at a nightclub in the capital of the Dominican Republic early on Tuesday, authorities said. Crews were searching for potential survivors in the rubble at Jet Set in Santo Domingo, said Juan Manuel Méndez, director of the Center of Emergency Operations. “We presume that many of them are still alive, and that is why the authorities here will not give up until not a single person remains under that rubble,” he said. Nelsy Cruz, the governor of Montecristi, was among the victims. Meanwhile, the injured include merengue singer Rubby Pérez, who was performing when the roof collapsed, officials said. His manager, Enrique Paulino, whose shirt was spattered with blood, told reporters at the scene that the concert began shortly before midnight, with the roof collapsing almost an hour later, killing the group’s saxophonist. “It happened so quickly. I managed to throw myself into a corner,” he said, adding that he initially thought it was an earthquake. President Luis Abinader wrote on X that all rescue agencies were “working tirelessly” to help those affected. “We deeply regret the tragedy that occurred at the Jet Set nightclub.
