      "description": "Hours after Donald Trump’s latest tariffs came into effect, China has announced retaliatory measures: an additional 50 percent tariff on US goods, on top of a planned 34 percent charge, and adding a further 12 US companies to its export control list. “The US’s practice of escalating tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake, which seriously infringes on China’s legitimate rights and interests and seriously damages the rules-based multilateral trading system,” the country’s Tariff Commission said in a statement. Last week China announced a 34 percent tariff on goods imported from the US, matching the rate that the US would impose on Chinese goods. Trump took that badly, adding an additional 50 percent levy, which China is now matching in return. The new US tariffs on China, and other countries around the world, took effect today, with the 84 percent rate added onto existing 20 percent tariffs for a total of 104 percent. China’s 84 percent levy on US goods will come into force tomorrow, April 10th. In addition to the elevated tariffs, China has added 12 US companies to its export control list, joining 16 additions from last week. That move bans the export of dual-use items – anything that can be used for both civilian and military purposes – to those companies. The European Union is expected to confirm its own retaliatory measures soon, with a vote taking place today.",

      "description": "This is only a concept art rendering for now, but gives us some idea of what to expect. Universal, having just completed its latest Nintendo- and Harry Potter-filled theme park in the US, is now planning to build a new theme park and resort in the United Kingdom. The multi-billion dollar project will be Universal’s first European theme park, with construction on the 476-acre complex expected to start next year in Bedford, England, located around 60 miles north of London. Set to open in 2031, the UK government says the theme park will be “one of the largest and most advanced in Europe,” projected to generate nearly £50 billion ($64 billion) for the British economy by 2055 and attract 8.5 million visitors in its first year. Rumors about the project have been circling since Comcast NBC Universal acquired the sizable chunk of Bedford land in December 2023, with today’s announcement finally confirming that plans to build the park are going ahead — subject to securing planning approval. “Today we closed the deal on a multi-billion-pound investment that will see Bedford home to one of the biggest entertainment parks in Europe, firmly putting the county on the global stage,” said UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who added that the project is expected to create “28,000 new jobs across sectors such as construction, AI, and tourism.” This announcement comes ahead of Universal opening its third Orlando park, Epic Universe, on May 22nd.

Framework has confirmed it will no longer be opening US preorders for the new Laptop 12 today, or announcing a price, as it evaluates the impact of Trump’s tariffs. The modular, convertible laptop will still be available later today for buyers elsewhere, including Canada and Europe. The Laptop 12 is Framework’s smallest laptop yet, and its first convertible touchscreen model. It comes with a 13th Gen Intel Core i3 or i5 chip, a 1920×1200 touchscreen with stylus support, and up to 48GB of RAM and 2TB of storage. Like other Framework hardware, it’s modular and repairable. It also ships in a pastel pink and mint finish that we’re pretty fond of. Although the company hasn’t announced pricing, it pitched the 12-inch laptop as an “entry-level” model at a “lower cost” than the Laptop 13. That model now starts at $899 for a DIY version, or $1,099 for a prebuilt one, after the company “paused” sales on some of the cheaper Laptop 13 models in the US to avoid selling them at a loss after factoring in the new tariffs. Framework manufactures its products in Taiwan, which is subject to a 32 percent tariff as of today. The company explained on Bluesky that it’s beginning its tariff response with the “most reversible” changes, delisting and delaying products, and that it will avoid raising prices “until we have final confirmation that there is no alternative.” We’re delaying opening pre-orders for Framework Lapt",

      "description": "Copilot Vision running on Windows 11. | Image: Microsoft Microsoft has started testing a new update to its Copilot app on Windows that will let you share your screen or apps with the AI assistant. Copilot Vision was originally limited to Microsoft’s Edge browser, but it’s now extending to any app on your PC. Copilot Vision will be able to do things like coach you through using Adobe Photoshop features, or analyze the photos and webpages you’re looking at. I got to see an early version of Copilot Vision on Windows at Microsoft’s 50th anniversary party last week, where the AI assistant guided me through a game of Minecraft and helped to optimize settings in Microsoft’s Clipchamp video editor. View this post on Instagram A post shared by The Verge (@verge) I haven’t been able to fully test Copilot Vision on Windows through the Insider beta because Microsoft is limiting the experience to US testers only. Copilot will be able to highlight parts of your screen to guide you through apps, although this initial beta version won’t have the feature enabled just yet. Copilot Vision might sound similar to Microsoft’s Recall feature that automatically takes snapshots if you allow it, but it’s actually more like screen sharing an app or your entire desktop in a Microsoft Teams call. Microsoft has also started testing file search in Copilot on Windows, allowing you to ask the AI assistant about the contents of a file on your PC. File search supports .docx, .xlsx, .pptx, .txt, .pdf, .json fil",

      "description": "President Donald Trump’s promised higher tariffs have gone into effect today, targeting many countries whose goods imported to the US were already subject to a 10 percent base tariff that started on April 5th. China has already retaliated in an escalation of Trump’s global trade war. The White House announced the tariffs on April 2nd, dubiously claiming they were “reciprocal” based on a nonsensical formula that far exceeded conventionally calculated tariffs. At the same time it declared a national emergency and stated that the higher tariffs would stay until Trump “determines that the threat posed by the trade deficit and underlying nonreciprocal treatment is satisfied, resolved, or mitigated.” Countries targeted for higher tariffs included China at 34 percent, the EU at 20 percent, and Vietnam at 46 percent, but since the tariffs are additive, some of the real numbers are much higher — Trump had already slapped 20 percent tariffs on China, and added another 50 percent this week after China announced retaliatory measures, bringing it to a total 104 percent. That means the total tariff more than doubles import costs for everything shipped from China, including the majority of the world’s components and consumer electronics. The EU will vote on its own retaliatory tariffs today. China announced another 50 percent tariff — matching Trump’s — on all US goods in retaliation. It’s set to go into effect on April 10th.

If you’re interested in streaming either, new and eligible returning subscribers can sign up for Apple TV Plus through April 24th for just $2.99 a month for the first three months. Apple TV Plus would normally cost you $9.99 a month, meaning you’re saving $21 over a three-month period. In addition to Severance and The Studio, Apple TV Plus also grants you ad-free access to other originals — including Ted Lasso and For All Mankind — all of which you can stream in 4K HDR, download to watch offline, and share with up to five family members. The platform also features a wide variety of movies, including Killers of the Flower Moon, Napoleon, The Gorge, Wolfs, and The Instigators. More into sports? Apple TV Plus is home to Friday Night Baseball and select Major League Soccer matches from MLS Season Pass. Just make sure to set a reminder for yourself to cancel your subscription within the next three months. Otherwise, your plan will automatically renew at the going rate (currently $9.99 a month) once the limited-time promotion period ends. As for what defines an “eligible returning subscriber,” we’ve reached out to Apple for clarification, and we’ll update the post if we hear back.",

The company has publicly resisted building an iPad Instagram app before. In February 2022 (more than three years ago!) Instagram boss Adam Mosseri replied to a post from Marques Brownlee about Meta still not having an Instagram app for iPad to explain why. “We get this one a lot,” Mosseri said. “It’s still just not a big enough group of people to be a priority.

But a decade later, Trump’s staggering and inexplicable new US tariffs are driving him out of business. Just as he was about to turn a profit for the first time, just before he was about to bring a new product to retail, he tells The Verge that his company can no longer survive as-is. He says that despite lifetime Arduboy sales of over $1 million, much of it from recent growth in 2023 and 2024, Trump’s new 104 percent China tariffs will be the beginning of the end. “I just like making circuit boards and helping people learn to code games. This is all too much,” he says. Even if he wanted to — Bates admits he’s been looking to sunset Arduboy for a while — he says he wouldn’t be able to satisfy Trump’s stated goal of restarting manufacturing in the US. “There are no manufacturers in the USA who would even answer an email to produce Arduboy, much less give a good price. I could build them myself and end up making about $10 an hour, still paying a crazy amount for components.” Instead, he says, his options are to dramatically raise prices, find a way around the tariffs, or simply kill off Arduboy for good. “The fact Arduboy could exist at all was kind of a miracle of global trade. An individual person, producing and distributing an international product with margins that would never work at a larger company. I didn’t need 80 percen",
