    "rewritten": "<p>As we venture further into the 21st century, the realm of futurology is becoming increasingly relevant. From AI-powered taxis to the potential of gene-edited food, we are living in a world that once seemed confined to the pages of science fiction.</p><p>Uber's partnership with Momenta marks another step towards a future of driverless vehicles. However, as AI becomes more powerful, it's also becoming more unpredictable. As these systems produce incorrect information more frequently, we must question the reliability of our automated future.</p><p>Meanwhile, the space race takes a new turn. As NASA shifts its focus to Mars, China is narrowing down the site for its Lunar Base. The moon, once a symbol of American achievement, may soon bear the flag of another nation.</p><p>On Earth, scientists are tackling AI's surging energy costs with atom-thin semiconductors. Yet, as technology advances, so do its implications. Cryptocurrency, for instance, may be evolving into a shadow banking system, raising questions about financial security in the digital age.</p><p>Finally, the approval of CRISPR pigs for food could mark a new era in consumer products. As gene editing becomes more prevalent, we must consider the ethical implications of such advancements. The future is now, and it's our responsibility to navigate it wisely.</p><blockquote>\"As AI becomes more powerful, it's also becoming more unpredictable.\"</blockquote><blockquote>\"The future is now, and it's our responsibility to navigate it wisely.\"</blockquote>",
