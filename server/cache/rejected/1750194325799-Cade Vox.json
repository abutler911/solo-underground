    "title": "Trump wants a Golden Dome missile defense shield. Is that realistic?",
    "description": "Since last week, Israel has been attacking Irans nuclear facilities, along with many other targets around the country. Iran has fired hundreds of missiles in response. NPR correspondent Geoff Brumfiel has been watching all of this very closely because Israels missile defenses have been a focus of the Trump White House. This year, President Trump requested funding from Congress for a Golden Dome for America — a missile defense system that would protect all of the United States. The idea comes from Israels Iron Dome — a network of interceptor missiles stationed at points across the country. Iron Dome and related Israeli air defenses dont get every missile fired — including some launched in the past few days by Iran — but the Israeli military says it has intercepted thousands of rockets since it was built. Trying to get that kind of protection for America, though, might be a very different matter.

    "title": "The Iron Dome: Could America's 'Golden Dome' be the Silver Bullet?",
    "rewritten": "<p>In the vibrant geopolitical chessboard that is the Middle East, Israel has upped its game, launching attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities and various other targets, with Iran replying in kind with a barrage of missiles. NPR's hawk-eyed Geoff Brumfiel has been glued to the unfolding events, given the Trump administration's keen interest in Israel's missile defenses.</p><p>This year, the Trump White House presented a grand vision to Congress - the 'Golden Dome', a missile defense system designed to provide a nationwide shield. The concept is a page out of Israel's playbook, specifically its 'Iron Dome', a grid of interceptor missiles deployed across the country. While the Iron Dome doesn't have a perfect track record - failing to nab every missile fired, including some recent ones from Iran - the Israeli military claims it has successfully intercepted thousands since its inception.</p><p>However, transferring this protective umbrella to American soil may not be as straightforward as it seems.
