    "rewritten": "<p>As we hurtle towards the future, the line between science fiction and reality blurs. The technological leaps we are witnessing today, from AI-driven taxis to gene-edited pigs, are both exhilarating and disconcerting.</p><p>Uber's recent partnership with Momenta to launch driverless rides in Europe is a testament to the rapid advancements in AI. Yet, as these autonomous vehicles hit the roads, we must also grapple with the unsettling fact that AI is becoming more powerful and its 'hallucinations' are getting worse. The reasoning systems are producing incorrect information more often, and alarmingly, even the companies don't know why.</p><p>Meanwhile, as NASA pivots to Mars, China is zeroing in on the Moon. The space race is not just about exploration, but also about geopolitical power and influence. As these superpowers chart their celestial paths, the implications for international relations on Earth are profound.</p><p>Back on Earth, the UK is tackling AI's surging energy costs with atom-thin semiconductors, a development that could redefine the tech industry's approach to sustainability. At the same time, the US has approved CRISPR pigs for food, marking a significant step in the consumer application of gene editing.</p><p>As we navigate this brave new world, it's crucial that we consider the ethical, environmental, and societal implications of these advancements. The future is now, and it's up to us to shape it.</p><blockquote>\"The future is now, and it's up to us to shape it.\"</blockquote><blockquote>\"As we navigate this brave new world, it's crucial that we consider the ethical, environmental, and societal implications of these advancements.\"</blockquote>",
